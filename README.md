## 📊 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Despite strong national sales figures, the company's sales team often lacks a clear, data-driven understanding of how performance varies across U.S. regions. This gap in visibility makes it difficult to identify growth opportunities, allocate resources effectively, and respond to market shifts.

### Business Challenges
- Revenue and profitability fluctuate inconsistently across regions, with no centralized view of performance drivers.

- Seasonal trends, top-selling SKUs, and channel-level profitability are obscured by fragmented reporting.

- Strategic decisions are often reactive rather than proactive due to limited historical insight.

### Project Goal
Leverage 5 years of historical sales data to:
- Uncover regional trends and performance disparities
- Evaluate profitability across products, channels, and seasons
- Pinpoint growth levers and inform resource allocation strategies

## 🛠️ Technical Workflow

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Data Collection** | Consolidated multi-source sales data from Excel files and conducted schema analysis to ensure structural consistency across inputs. |
| **2. Data Cleaning** | Applied robust preprocessing techniques to remove duplicates, impute missing values, standardize formats, and normalize column structures for analytical readiness. |
| **3. Data Loading & Initial Exploration** | Loaded cleaned data into Google Colab and used Python for initial profiling, schema validation, and exploratory checks to guide deeper analysis. |
| **4. Exploratory Data Analysis** | Conducted historical trend analysis to uncover performance patterns, outliers, and correlations. Synthesized findings into clear, stakeholder-ready insights. |
| **5. Dashboarding & Communication** | Built a live, interactive Power BI dashboard tailored for business users, enabling self-service exploration and supporting strategic conversations through visual storytelling. |
